# Pairing on Reflecting

At Makers, we engaged in pair programming every day. Makers believes that pair programming produces higher quality software, increased knowledge sharing, and better communication, replacing any sense of competition with a sense of collaboration. 

So, we decided to apply pairing to writing a post on reflecting on our journey towards becoming oftware developers. 

## Q&A

In this section, we answer questions about our backgrounds, experiences and most importantly about our journey while at Makers. The idea of answering questions 
in an individual manner enables us to reflect on two unique perceptions of the same yet significantly different experience.

### Generic Questions

> Tell us a few words about yourself

> What attracted you to Software Engineering and a potential career in it?

> How scary is it to change careers and migrate to an entirely different professional field?

### While-at-Makers Questions

> What were your favorite and least favorite weeks? Why?

> What was/were the most challenging aspect/s of the bootcamp?

> What was the driving force that kept you going?

> What are the Top 3 skills you've gained throughout the bootcamp?
